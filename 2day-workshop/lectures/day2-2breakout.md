# Exercise in breakout rooms (1 hour)

Now you will put together everything you have learned until now.

What you need:
- Notes from this workshop
- Dataset of your own
- R/python scripts used to analyzed this data


Steps:
1. Create a project folder with `DrWatson`
2. Put your data in the `data` folder
3. Put your R/python code in the `scripts` folder
4. Create a jl file with the same name as your R/python code in the `scripts` folder. For example, if your R code is called `my-scripts.r`, you will create a `my-scripts.jl` file
5. Open the jl file in VSCode (or any editor you like), and translate the R/python code into Julia
6. We will share the code with others at the end of the session
7. If you push your project to github, add the link to your code in the following section via a pull request
