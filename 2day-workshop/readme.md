# Julia workshop for Data Science

This repository contains the notes of the Julia workshop taught at CIMAT in October 26-27, 2020.


## In preparation for the course
- Bring a small dataset that you can analyze in class (preferably LMM-related, but not exclusively)
- Bring an R (or python) script with the code that you would normally use to analyze the dataset
- Read the syllabus below and checkout the resources in the "In preparation" column
- [Download](https://julialang.org/) julia in your computer
- Clone this repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/crsl4/julia-workshop.git
```
